# StretchSolver
A python program based on GOPs and GPS using PyQt5

---

### Description

This program is highly inspired by MuTsun Tsai's Box Pleating Studio. Next, I saw @plant trying it out as well so I guess I would also give it a try.

For now, I do not have much experience in python GUI programming. So I am starting off with learning PyQt5.
